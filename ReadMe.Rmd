This assignment is conducted within the scope of Coursera Getting and Cleaning
Data course. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect,
work with, and clean a data set. For this, we need to prepare tidy data that can
be used for later analysis.



```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
